			<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
				It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.
				HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response.
				HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="An_overview_of_HTTP">
			<header>An overview of HTTP</header>
			<p>HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.
				It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
				A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more. </p>
			<img class="image" src='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview/fetching_a_page.png'>
			<p>Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data).
				The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses. </p>
			<img class="image" src='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview/http-layers.png'>
			<p>Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time.
				It is an application layer protocol that is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used.
				Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results.
				HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand. </p>

			<header>Evolution of HTTP</header>
			<p>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web.
				Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991, HTTP has gone through many changes that have helped maintain its simplicity while shaping its flexibility.
				Keep reading to learn how HTTP evolved from a protocol designed to exchange files in a semi-trusted laboratory environment into a modern internet maze that carries images and videos in high resolution and 3D.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Invention_of_the_World_Wide_Web">
				<header>Invention of the World Wide Web</header>
			<p>In 1989, while working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to build a hypertext system over the internet.
				Initially called the Mesh, it was later renamed the World Wide Web during its implementation in 1990.
				Built over the existing TCP and IP protocols, it consisted of 4 building blocks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A textual format to represent hypertext documents, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
				<li>A simple protocol to exchange these documents, the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</li>
				<li>A client to display (and edit) these documents, the first web browser called the WorldWideWeb.</li>
				<li>A server to give access to the document, an early version of httpd.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These four building blocks were completed by the end of 1990, and the first servers were running outside of CERN by early 1991.
				On August 6, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee posted on the public alt.hypertext newsgroup.
				This is now considered to be the official start of the World Wide Web as a public project.</p>
			<p>The HTTP protocol used in those early phases was very simple.
				It was later dubbed HTTP/0.9 and is sometimes called the one-line protocol.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="HTTP/0.9_-_The_one-line_protocol">
			<header>HTTP/0.9 - The one-line protocol</header>
			<p>The initial version of HTTP had no version number; it was later called 0.9 to differentiate it from later versions.
				HTTP/0.9 was extremely simple: requests consisted of a single line and started with the only possible method GET followed by the path to the resource.
				The full URL wasn't included as the protocol, server, and port weren't necessary once connected to the server.</p>
			<code>GET /mypage.html</code>
			<p>The response was extremely simple, too: it only consisted of the file itself.</p>
				<code>
					&lt;html><br>
					A very simple HTML page<br>
					&lt;html></code>
			<p>Unlike subsequent evolutions, there were no HTTP headers.
				This meant that only HTML files could be transmitted.
				There were no status or error codes.
				If there was a problem, a specific HTML file was generated and included a description of the problem for human consumption.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="HTTP/1.0_-_Building_extensibility">
		<header>HTTP/1.0 - Building extensibility</header>
		<p>HTTP/0.9 was very limited, but browsers and servers quickly made it more versatile:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Versioning information was sent within each request (<code>HTTP/1.0</code> was appended to the <code>GET</code> line).</li>
			<li>A status code line was also sent at the beginning of a response.
				This allowed the browser itself to recognize the success or failure of a request and adapt its behavior accordingly.
				For example, updating or using its local cache in a specific way.</li>
			<li>The concept of HTTP headers was introduced for both requests and responses.
				Metadata could be transmitted and the protocol became extremely flexible and extensible.</li>
			<li>Documents other than plain HTML files could be transmitted thanks to the <code>Content-Type</code> header.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>At this point in time, a typical request and response looked like this:</p>
		<code>GET /mypage.html HTTP/1.0<br>
			User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)<br>
			<br>
			200 OK<br>
			Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT<br>
			Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17<br>
			Content-Type: text/html<br>
			&lt;HTML><br>
			A page with an image<br>
			&lt;IMG SRC="/myimage.gif"><br>
			&lt;/HTML><br>
			</code>
		<p>It was followed by a second connection and a request to fetch the image (with the corresponding response):</p>
		<code>GET /myimage.gif HTTP/1.0<br>
			User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)<br>
			<br>
			200 OK<br>
			Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:32 GMT<br>
			Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17<br>
			Content-Type: text/gif<br>
			(image content)<br>
			</code>
			<p>Between 1991-1995, these were introduced with a try-and-see approach.
				A server and a browser would add a feature and see if it got traction.
				Interoperability problems were common.
				In an effort to solve these issues, an informational document that described the common practices was published in November 1996.
				This was known as RFC 1945 and defined HTTP/1.0.</p>
</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="HTTP_Messages">
			<header>HTTP Messages</header>
			<p>HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client.
				There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and responses, the answer from the server.</p>
			<p>HTTP messages are composed of textual information encoded in ASCII, and span over multiple lines.
				In HTTP/1.1, and earlier versions of the protocol, these messages were openly sent across the connection.
				In HTTP/2, the once human-readable message is now divided up into HTTP frames, providing optimization and performance improvements.</p>
			<p>Web developers, or webmasters, rarely craft these textual HTTP messages themselves: software, a Web browser, proxy, or Web server, perform this action.
				They provide HTTP messages through config files (for proxies or servers), APIs (for browsers), or other interfaces.</p>
			<img class="image" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages/httpmsg2.png">
			<p>The HTTP/2 binary framing mechanism has been designed to not require any alteration of the APIs or config files applied: it is broadly transparent to the user.</p>
			<p>HTTP requests, and responses, share similar structure and are composed of:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A start-line describing the requests to be implemented, or its status of whether successful or a failure. This start-line is always a single line.</li>
				<li>An optional set of HTTP headers specifying the request, or describing the body included in the message.</li>
				<li>A blank line indicating all meta-information for the request has been sent.</li>
				<li>An optional body containing data associated with the request (like content of an HTML form), or the document associated with a response. The presence of the body and its size is specified by the start-line and HTTP headers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The start-line and HTTP headers of the HTTP message are collectively known as the head of the requests, whereas its payload is known as the body.</p>

			<header>A typical HTTP session</header>
			<p>In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).</li>
				<li>The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.</li>
				<li>The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As of HTTP/1.1, the connection is no longer closed after completing the third phase, and the client is now granted a further request: this means the second and third phases can now be performed any number of times.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="Establishing_a_connection">
		<header>Establishing a connection</header>
			<p>In client-server protocols, it is the client which establishes the connection.
				Opening a connection in HTTP means initiating a connection in the underlying transport layer, usually this is TCP.</p>
			<p>With TCP the default port, for an HTTP server on a computer, is port 80.
				Other ports can also be used, like 8000 or 8080.
				The URL of a page to fetch contains both the domain name, and the port number, though the latter can be omitted if it is 80.
